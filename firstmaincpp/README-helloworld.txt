In the spirit of "Hello World" and some of my first batch projects. Here's my first ever program in c++ from years ago. Technically my first program/hello was in java but that I was a mere 12 year old (I think) who deleted it.
I am well aware that cpp is out of place in a batch project but who cares its fun

"#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Please enter a number";
    int x;
    //= 5;
    int p = 10;
    x = p*5;
     std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
"

Theres another very small early snippit, also probably direct from a tutorial at that time
